# Cloud-init meta-data file
#
# This file is part of the NoCloud datasource configuration for cloud-init.
# It provides metadata about the instance to cloud-init during the Ubuntu
# installation process.
#
# The NoCloud datasource allows cloud-init to read configuration from a local
# source (in this case, Packer's HTTP server) without requiring a cloud provider.
#
# For a basic installation, this file can be empty, but it must exist.
# cloud-init expects both user-data and meta-data files to be present.
#
# Optional fields that could be included here:
# - instance-id: A unique identifier for this instance
# - local-hostname: The hostname for the system
#
# We leave this empty because our user-data file already specifies the hostname
# and other necessary configuration.

# Empty meta-data - required to exist but can be empty for basic setups
